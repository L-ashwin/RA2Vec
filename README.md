# RA2Vec
RA2Vec (Reduced Alphabet Embeddings) is a way to get distributed representation of amino acid sequences which then can be used for further downstream machine learning tasks. We have presented this work at 11th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Health Informatics. 
This repository contains the source code for generating RA2Vec embeddings with different parameters, few sample models which can directly used to convert sequences to embeddings, and a demo notebook which shows how to use RA2Vec models to transform protein sequence dataset to embeddings.
